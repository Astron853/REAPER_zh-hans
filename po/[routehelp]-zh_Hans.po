msgid "In a REAPER project, audio signals can be routed between hardware, tracks, and other ASIO-enabled applications."

#: ;82F995F7720559E9
msgid "Detailed routing for tracks and hardware can be visualized and edited using the project routing matrix (View/Routing Matrix)."

#: ;25AC41C1FA136A40
msgid "Each track can have up to 64 audio channels. Tracks can send audio from any channel on the sending track, to any channel on the receiving track."

msgid "Media items on a track can have up to 64 audio channels, which are output by default to the matching track channels."

msgid "Tracks can host track FX, and media item takes can host per-take FX."

msgid "FX sidechaining is using one audio signal (the source signal) to trigger an effect that is applied to another audio signal (the target signal)."
msgstr ""

#: ;B370D4C8DAB2AB19
msgid "This can be accomplished by creating a send from the source track, to higher-numbered channels on the target track."

#: ;2FF7B7BBD63B2DC7
msgid "For example, to use the stereo output of track A as a sidechain input for an FX on track B, create a send from track A channels 1+2 to track B channels 3+4."

#: ;CC30DC3E75F9CB9B
msgid "Sends can be created using the Routing Matrix, or the track routing dialog on either the source or target tracks, or by simply dragging the source track I/O routing button to the target track."

#: ;0601C02A4C024328
msgid "If the specific FX natively supports sidechaining, the sidechain input should be automatically enabled when channels 3+4 on the target track are created."
