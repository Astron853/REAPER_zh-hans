#: ;CBDC58413A534831
msgid "How aggressive audio processing threads are. A more relaxed setting will use less CPU but will be less stable at low latencies."

msgid "Media buffering uses RAM and CPU to avoid having to wait for disk IO. For systems with slower disks this should be set higher. Zero disables buffering."

msgid "How full source media buffers should be before starting playback. Lower numbers will give faster response time."
